# true_coach_apiplay

A new Flutter application.

## To Do List
- Figure out tween animations
   - one should be the letter getting big over 5 seconds
   - one should be the back ground image getting lighter over 5 seconds
   - the button should turn into a counter that counts down the seconds
   - around the button is a growing circle border that takes 5 seconds to complete
   - at the end of 5 seconds, background turns white and letter takes up whole screen, counter disappears
- Recording and sending recording
  - start recording on button click (coincides with animation start)
